🐶 Classification of Pet Faces

   This project focuses on building a deep learning model for image classification, specifically designed to recognize and classify pet images (such as cats and dogs).

🔍 Project Overview

   -> Developed a deep learning model to classify pet faces accurately.

   -> Utilized TensorFlow and Keras frameworks for building and training the model.
 
   -> Implemented the ResNet-50 architecture, which consists of 50 layers and incorporates residual connections to enhance learning performance and prevent vanishing gradients.

   -> Applied data augmentation techniques such as random flipping and rotation to improve the model’s robustness and generalization.
